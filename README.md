# Twitter_crawler
I want to develop a Twitter crawler to collect data, further to this, perform geo-tagging and conduct basic data analytics, and I also want to enhance the geo-tagged data.I will use Python programming languages and also MongoDb for data storage.        I will use streaming api to collect data, and will enhance the crawling using Streaming &amp; REST API by topic based. And I will grab geo-tagged data of Glasgow.       The basic data analytics includes 4 parts below:          1 count the amount of data collected, and specify amount of geo-tagged data in the data set;          2 count the amount of geo-tagged data from Glasgow, and measure if there is any overlap;          3 count redundant data present in the collection;          4 Count the re-tweets and quotes.              According to the idea of enhancing geo-location information of tweets, Less than 6% tweets have geo-location information. I will group similar tweets, and then assign a tweet location to each member of the group. I will use LSH based approach to group similar tweets.      LSH(Locality sensitive hashing) is an algorithm for grouping similar documents into a single bucket.
